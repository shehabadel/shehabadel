I am a Computer Engineering and Software Systems student in Ain Shams University. I have massive passion for everything related to computers especially fullstack web development, problem-solving and open-source contribution. I strive to build softwares that will leave an impact in people's lives. I am currently seeking Software Engineering Internships opportunities.

I also mix some music and a hardcore fan of FC Bayern Munchen and Daft Punk 🎷
